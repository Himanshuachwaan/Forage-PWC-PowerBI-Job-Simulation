# Forage-PWC-PowerBI-Job-Simulation
# I recently completed the Power BI Job Simulation certification provided by Forage PwC, and it was an enriching experience. Throughout the program, I gained a strong foundation in Power BI, learning data visualization, data transformation, and modeling. I learned how to use DAX for advanced calculations, harness Power Query for data transformation, and design effective, user-friendly reports. The training also covered important aspects of data security, governance, and collaboration. Real-world case studies and practical exercises allowed me to apply my knowledge on how can i solve business problems. This certification not only equipped me with valuable Power BI skills but also improved my ability to communicate insights effectively. It was an invaluable step in advancing my career in data analytics and reporting.
